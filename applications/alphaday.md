# Polymesh Association Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Alphaday
- **Team Name:** Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd.
- **Payment Address:** 2EG6nUN2d5S9d5CCLkxVup3mdg2QxMJiXPo9f25FhoPzhzkT (POLYX)  
- **Level:** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

We help solve the issue of information fragmentation and aim to serve as a central point where any user (whether they are a developer, enthusiast, investor) can instantly get the Polymesh information they need, stay up to date on the latest videos & podcasts featuring Polymesh and much more.

Alphaday is and will remain to be free-to-use for end users.

### Project Details

We’ve conducted market research on users and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow social feeds, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available on Alphaday.

We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People using Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into our app so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.

Example Dashboard: https://app.alphaday.com/b/aave/



### Ecosystem Fit

We do not have direct competitors who are competing in the experience aggregator space but our individual widgets do overlap with features offered by Dune, Nansen, Zapper/Zerion, Coingecko, Discord, DeFiLama, Snapshot.

Bear in mind that the above are feeding data to Alphaday itself.

If we get any early traction on the Polymesh dashboard we can immediately start to build more Polymesh-exclusive widgets. This would likely entail API integrations into the dashboard, such as the already integrated Uniswap widget.

We aim to create a dashboard that serves any Polymesh user, holders, developers, VCs, and pretty much any stakeholder whether they are completely new to the Polymesh ecosystem or an expert.

## Future Plans

If we get a grant we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we use forums and other channels available to gather feedback and tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that Polymesh stakeholders truly love to use.

We have just recently released a new mobile app version of Alphaday. The dashboard will be available on the desktop version, and we will adapt the new mobile app to automatically filter the ‘superfeed’ based on each project’s url; e.g. ‘/b/polymesh’ would direct users to the alphaday superfeed page and automatically filter it for Polymesh.

Other future plans include further development of the app as a whole, and adding new features and functionalities. We have also started focusing on marketing more this year to boost the value our partners get from us, as well as to increase awareness of Alphaday.
